# Reference

This branch contains my Python OOP tutorials from [kelas terbuka](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PjHsUnOkes&list=PLZS-MHyEIRo7ab0-EveSvf4CLdyOECMm0) â€” a YouTube channel's name that is managed by Faqihza Mukhlish, a Lecturer that teaches Physics Engineering in ITB (Bandung Institute of Technology), Bandung, Indonesia. It also acts like a note to myself where I can read again after what I've just written.
